## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is first project in my life so I learned a lot of things but the most important one is I think that,
I learned how to use flex-box and how to center qr code component.

### Continued development

I'll definitely focus more on flex-box and CSS Grid because I need a lot of practice if I want to master them.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot ot understand flex-box.
